#Postmortem: Outage Incident

##Issue Summary:
 Duration: The outage occurred from April 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM UTC to April 16, 2024, at 2:00 AM UTC, lasting a total of 16 hours.
 Impact: The primary impact was on the patient appointment scheduling service, which experienced complete unavailability during the outage period. Approximately 80% of users attempting to access the service were affected, resulting in frustration and disruption to healthcare provider-patient interactions.
 Root Cause: The outage was caused by a database corruption issue that led to the failure of critical data retrieval processes, rendering the appointment scheduling system inaccessible.

##Timeline:
 April 15, 2024
   10:00 AM UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating database connectivity failures.
   Engineers initiated investigation, suspecting a potential database server misconfiguration.
   Initial attempts made to restart database services to restore functionality.
   Misleading investigation path: Engineers focused on network infrastructure as a potential cause, leading to wasted time.
 April 15-16, 2024
   Incident escalated to database administration team as the issue persisted despite initial troubleshooting efforts.
   Further analysis revealed database corruption as the root cause of the outage.
   Database recovery processes initiated to restore data integrity and service functionality.
 April 16, 2024
   2:00 AM UTC: Service restored after successful database recovery and verification processes.

##Root Cause and Resolution:
 Root Cause: The outage was attributed to database corruption resulting from a faulty disk controller that caused data inconsistencies and prevented proper data retrieval.
 Resolution: The issue was addressed by replacing the malfunctioning disk controller, followed by database recovery procedures to restore data integrity. Verification tests were conducted to ensure the system's stability and functionality post-resolution.

##Corrective and Preventative Measures:
 Improvements/Fixes:
   Implement automated database health checks and integrity monitoring to detect early signs of corruption or data inconsistencies.
   Enhance disaster recovery mechanisms to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of similar incidents.
 Tasks to Address the Issue:
  1. Replace faulty disk controller with a redundant and reliable alternative.
  2. Implement regular database integrity checks and scheduled maintenance procedures.
  3. Update incident response protocols to streamline escalation processes and improve coordination among teams.
  4. Conduct thorough post-incident analysis to identify additional vulnerabilities and areas for improvement in the system's architecture and infrastructure.

In conclusion, the outage incident underscored the critical importance of robust data management practices and proactive monitoring in ensuring the reliability and availability of essential healthcare services. By implementing corrective measures and preventive strategies, we aim to mitigate the risk of similar incidents in the future and uphold our commitment to delivering seamless patient care experiences.
